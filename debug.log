You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.*\nAliExpress is fine to start with. Make sure you do some form of product research to ensure there is a market for the product. Figure out how you will market the product before you decide to sell it, ie don’t just pick a product (charging station) and market it just as a charging station. You need to pick specific angles that will solve problems for people.\n\nYes you can use images and videos from AliExpress but I would advise to only use high quality ones. Best bet is to purchase the product yourself (or ask the seller for a sample) and take your own. You’ll need to anyway for your ad creatives.\nI mean there\'s autoDS but I wouldn\'t suggest it and here\'s why\nhttps://youtu.be/PSOkmzjmWRc?si=bk4NS7HxgKw-2wkj\n\nCheck out the comment section too and you can see how many people dislike using Autods.

I\'ve been using this setup for 3+ years now.\n\nIf the videos and photos are good quality then yes you can use them but the videos don\'t tend to do well for advertisements as they\'re not made for video ads.\n------\nPost ID: 1hbpira\nTitle: Too saturated of a product?\nScore: 5\nFirst 3 Comments:\n**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**  \n    + help keep r/dropship SPAM free \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Make sure you do some form of product research to ensure there is a market for the product. Figure out how you will market the product before you decide to sell it, ie don’t just pick a product (charging station) and market it just as a charging station. You need to pick specific angles that will solve problems for people.\n\nYes you can use images and videos from AliExpress but I would advise to only use high quality ones. Best bet is to purchase the product yourself (or ask the seller for a sample) and take your own. You’ll need to anyway for your ad creatives.\nI mean there\'s autoDS but I wouldn\'t suggest it and here\'s why\nhttps://youtu.be/PSOkmzjmWRc?si=bk4NS7HxgKw-2wkj\n\nCheck out the comment section too and you can see how many people dislike using Autods.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.*\nAliExpress is fine to start with. Make sure you do some form of product research to ensure there is a market for the product. Figure out how you will market the product before you decide to sell it, ie don’t just pick a product (charging station) and market it just as a charging station. You need to pick specific angles that will solve problems for people.\n\nYes you can use images and videos from AliExpress but I would advise to only use high quality ones. Best bet is to purchase the product yourself (or ask the seller for a sample) and take your own. You’ll need to anyway for your ad creatives.\nI mean there\'s autoDS but I wouldn\'t suggest it and here\'s why\nhttps://youtu.be/PSOkmzjmWRc?si=bk4NS7HxgKw-2wkj\n\nCheck out the comment section too and you can see how many people dislike using Autods. Some have also been scammed by them too.\n\nAnother is Cjdropshipping\nhttps://youtu.be/gWO9kobS4hE?si=Q_ZNc7J2LwD3k7ZH\nI\'m not even too sure how they\'re running tbh.\n\nThe only app I do recommend using is DSers with AliExpress and here\'s why\nhttps://youtu.be/Ote0twG4Wlo?si=Zku7mCUeLi0bU-Nj\n\nI have plenty of videos that go through AliExpress. I\'ve been using this setup for 3+ years now.\n\nIf the videos and photos are good quality then yes you can use them but the videos don\'t tend to do well for advertisements as they\'re not made for video ads.\n------\nPost ID: 1hbpira\nTitle: Too saturated of a product?\nScore: 6\nFirst 3 Comments:\n**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**  \n    + help keep r/dropship SPAM free \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\'ve generated over $5M from dropshipping in 4 years and still haven\'t retired my parents. And the fact his friend claims that he doesn\'t ship the items out is pure fraud and stupid. I hope chargebacks creep up on him. He\'s the reason for payment holds and Facebook bans that happen so frequently these days.\n\nScum people with no morals.\n\nIf you want to learn dropshipping the proper way here are all my YouTube videos in order\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB\nI would not even call that a method, its fraud that gets put a end to very quickly.  \nYou would need to have a already established store that you are willing to sacrifice for a payday (and legal issues afterwards) to get much money out of it.\n\nThis is why you see people starting out with long hold periods, so they can just refund it if you dont deliver and ban you.\n\n>and is able to live like the rest of his dropshipping bros.\n\nAlso you accidently wrote "dropshipping bros" when its "course selling bros".  \nNone of the people in videos like that are making their money dropshipping, they make their money selling you content/courses and affiliate marketing from you signing up to services.\n------\n\n\n    Return only a comma-separated list of post IDs without any additional text.\n    '}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'max_tokens': 500, 'temperature': 0.7}}

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.*\nAliExpress is fine to start with. Make sure you do some form of product research to ensure there is a market for the product. Figure out how you will market the product before you decide to sell it, ie don’t just pick a product (charging station) and market it just as a charging station. You need to pick specific angles that will solve problems for people.\n\nYes you can use images and videos from AliExpress but I would advise to only use high quality ones. Best bet is to purchase the product yourself (or ask the seller for a sample) and take your own. You’ll need to anyway for your ad creatives.\nI mean there's autoDS but I wouldn't suggest it and here's why\nhttps://youtu.be/PSOkmzjmWRc?si=bk4NS7HxgKw-2wkj\n\nCheck out the comment section too and you can see how many people dislike using Autods. Some have also been scammed by them too.\n\nAnother is Cjdropshipping\nhttps://youtu.be/gWO9kobS4hE?si=Q_ZNc7J2LwD3k7ZH\nI'm not even too sure how they're running tbh.\n\nThe only app I do recommend using is DSers with AliExpress and here's why\nhttps://youtu.be/Ote0twG4Wlo?si=Zku7mCUeLi0bU-Nj\n\nI have plenty of videos that go through AliExpress. I've been using this setup for 3+ years now.\n\nIf the videos and photos are good quality then yes you can use them but the videos don't tend to do well for advertisements as they're not made for video ads.\n------\n\n\n        Provide insights, trends, or recommendations based on these posts.\n        "}], 'model': 'gpt-4-turbo', 'max_tokens': 3000, 'temperature': 0.7}}

For HTML emails, get a solid template designed up and then it’s easy to swap in new creative each time. Canva is your friend or get someone on Fiverr to help. \n3. Set up a few smart automations—might take you an hour—and then establish a send cadence; maybe one email a week. Again, this shouldn’t take more than 30-60 minutes an email. Time well spent. Provides you’ve got a database of course. \n4. If your database is tiny—under 50—you could even just send the odd email directly to key customers. “Hey, John here.

For HTML emails, get a solid template designed up and then it’s easy to swap in new creative each time. Canva is your friend or get someone on Fiverr to help. \n3.

Provides you’ve got a database of course. \n4. If your database is tiny—under 50—you could even just send the odd email directly to key customers. “Hey, John here.

Once you start seeing results you can then invest money.\n\nIf you're just cold calling you'll land in spam folders and that's pointless. Get people to sign up and verify your domain so you land in their actual inbox!\nYep! I was doing 30%+ of my revenue through email. And it was incremental revenue. \n\nYou don’t have to overbake it. \n\n1. Text emails are underrated. \n2. For HTML emails, get a solid template designed up and then it’s easy to swap in new creative each time. Canva is your friend or get someone on Fiverr to help. \n3. Set up a few smart automations—might take you an hour—and then establish a send cadence; maybe one email a week. Again, this shouldn’t take more than 30-60 minutes an email. Time well spent. Provides you’ve got a database of course. \n4. If your database is tiny—under 50—you could even just send the odd email directly to key customers. “Hey, John here. I’m the owner of XYZ… Just wanted to mention…”\n------\nPost ID: 1hdlno3\nTitle: Dropshipping in 2024: A Comedy Special\nScore: 26\nFirst 3 Comments:\n**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**  \n    + help keep r/dropship SPAM free \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I plan on working more on this next year and have a decent list to start of people who have signed up to a newsletter.\n\nIt shouldn't be costly at all when you start as free plans are provided with limitations. Once you start seeing results you can then invest money.\n\nIf you're just cold calling you'll land in spam folders and that's pointless. Get people to sign up and verify your domain so you land in their actual inbox!\nYep! I was doing 30%+ of my revenue through email. And it was incremental revenue. \n\nYou don’t have to overbake it. \n\n1. Text emails are underrated. \n2. For HTML emails, get a solid template designed up and then it’s easy to swap in new creative each time. Canva is your friend or get someone on Fiverr to help. \n3. Set up a few smart automations—might take you an hour—and then establish a send cadence; maybe one email a week. Again, this shouldn’t take more than 30-60 minutes an email. Time well spent. Provides you’ve got a database of course. \n4. If your database is tiny—under 50—you could even just send the odd email directly to key customers. “Hey, John here.

And it was incremental revenue. \n\nYou don’t have to overbake it. \n\n1. Text emails are underrated. \n2. For HTML emails, get a solid template designed up and then it’s easy to swap in new creative each time. Canva is your friend or get someone on Fiverr to help. \n3. Set up a few smart automations—might take you an hour—and then establish a send cadence; maybe one email a week. Again, this shouldn’t take more than 30-60 minutes an email. Time well spent.

Once you start seeing results you can then invest money.\n\nIf you're just cold calling you'll land in spam folders and that's pointless. Get people to sign up and verify your domain so you land in their actual inbox!\nYep! I was doing 30%+ of my revenue through email. And it was incremental revenue. \n\nYou don’t have to overbake it. \n\n1. Text emails are underrated. \n2. For HTML emails, get a solid template designed up and then it’s easy to swap in new creative each time. Canva is your friend or get someone on Fiverr to help. \n3. Set up a few smart automations—might take you an hour—and then establish a send cadence; maybe one email a week. Again, this shouldn’t take more than 30-60 minutes an email. Time well spent. Provides you’ve got a database of course. \n4. If your database is tiny—under 50—you could even just send the odd email directly to key customers. “Hey, John here.
